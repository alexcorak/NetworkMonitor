# NetworkMonitor
This network monitor is a packet sniffing program that sees packets coming in on a network device by using JNetPcap. Sniffer contains the bulk of the code, while packet capture contains the main. It is not a perfect program but recognizes the common traffic packet types, and can give some info about it. This was Homework for my Advanced Networks class at EWU.
